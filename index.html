        <h1>About the Game</h1>
        <p>
          Rise of Ravens is a multiplayer game set in a futuristic world. The goal of the game is to demonstrate the
          inner workings of fascism and illustrate the rise of a fascist movement by letting the players experience it
          in a virtual manner.</br>
          In Rise of Ravens, one player will take on the role as leader of a fascist movement and others will play as
          their followers. Together they try to fulfil the goal of their movement – total domination.
          As the leader, you have to manage your resources and followers in order to steadily grow your influence and
          power. As your movement grows, you will have to promote some of your followers to take care of leadership
          responsibilities for you. But choose carefully, once your followers have had a taste of power, they might not
          want to give it up again.</br>
          As the follower, it is your responsibility to contribute to your leader’s success. Fulfil the tasks your
          leader gives you, be a good follower, and eventually you will see the movement flourish. Or maybe you would
          like to take control for yourself? Rise through the ranks of your movement, gain power for yourself, and you
          might just be able to do it.

        <h1>The 14 Signs of Fascism</h1>
        <p class="gallery-description">When researching fascism, there is no way around the 14 signs of fascism as
          defined by Umberto Eco.
          During the design process of Rise of Ravens, this list has always been a good resource to turn to and draw
          inspiration from.
          Below, you can read through the 14 signs, but if you want to learn more you can follow <a
            href="https://www.openculture.com/2016/11/umberto-eco-makes-a-list-of-the-14-common-features-of-fascism.html">this
            link</a>.

            <h2>1. The Cult of Tradition</h2>
            <p>One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers.
              The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="gallery-cell">
            <h2>2. The Rejection of Modernism</h2>
            <p>The Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense
              Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="gallery-cell">
            <h2>3. The Cult of Action for Action's Sake</h2>
            <p>Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking
              is a form of emasculation.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="gallery-cell">
            <h2>4. Disagreement is Treason</h2>
            <p>The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the
              scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="gallery-cell">
            <h2>5. Fear of Difference</h2>
            <p>The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus
              Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="gallery-cell">
            <h2>6. Appeal to Social Frustration.</h2>
            <p>One of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a
              class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the
              pressure of lower social groups.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="gallery-cell">
            <h2>7. The Obsession with a Plot</h2>
            <p>Thus at the root of the Ur-Fascist psychology there is the obsession with a plot, possibly an
              international one. The followers must feel besieged.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="gallery-cell">
            <h2>8. The Enemy is both Strong and Weak</h2>
            <p>By a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="gallery-cell">
            <h2>9. Pacifism is Trafficking with the Enemy</h2>
            <p>For Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="gallery-cell">
            <h2>10. Contempt for the Weak</h2>
            <p>Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="gallery-cell">
            <h2>11. Everybody is Educated to become a Hero</h2>
            <p>In Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of
              death.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="gallery-cell">
            <h2>12. Machismo and Weaponry</h2>
            <p>Machismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits,
              from chastity to homosexuality.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="gallery-cell">
            <h2>13. Selective Populism</h2>
            <p>There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of
              citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="gallery-cell">
            <h2>14. Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak</h2>
            <p>All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in
              order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.</p>

        <h1>Game Design</h1>
        <img src="img/use_case_diagram.png" alt="Diagram" class="responsive-image">
        <p>Above, you can see a rough sketch of the basic gameplay loop, wherein the leader has to manage their resources
          and followers to accomplish their task, finish his projects, and react to world events. However, as the movement
          grows, so does the number of things to manage. To help in this task, the leader can promote some of their
          followers, essentially making them leaders of their own, smaller subregions.</p>

        <h2>Leader View</h2>
        <p>The leader has to keep track of and manage a lot of things. Below is an example of what the UI looks like,
          including a world event (circle) a project (hexagon) as well as their associated tasks. To the right is a
          list of all the followers currently available to the leader. At the top left of the screen are the three key
          resources: influence, which indicates how much traction the movement is getting; public opinion, which
          indicates how well liked the leader currently is; and finally money, which is needed to fund all sorts of
          things, from items to projects. </p>
        <img src="img/strategy_hud_followers_expanded.png" alt="Strategy View" class="responsive-image">

        <h2>Follower View</h2>
        <p>Not every task has to end in conflict. But if it does, followers need to make sure they can come out
          successfully. Combat happens in a tactical turn-based system where the follower draws cards to decide what
          course of action they take. Below, you can see an example of such a scene and an example of what a level might
          look like.</p>

        <p>Red has been chosen as the main color because it invokes strong emotions. In a video game context, red
          often symbolizes enemies. In our case, your color is red. . . </p>

        <p>And below, the final version.</p>
        <img src="img/ravens_logo_transparent.png" alt="Ravens Logo" class="flex-img-small">
        <p>The Raven was chosen because it is commonly associated with intelligence and cunning, suvival, community, but
          also danger/warning. Furthermore, the raven as a symbol harkens back to the nordic myths. Perfect for a
          traditionalist movement.</p>
